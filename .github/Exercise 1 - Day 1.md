# [Git and GitHub]
[Getting familiar with Git terminology and basic tools.]

## Key terminology
[Source Code Management / Version Control: The way to keep track of the modifications to a source code in a repository.
Centralized Version Control: Version control where the versions of the code are stored only in a remote repository on the server.
Distributed Version Control: Version control where all the versions of the code are stored in a remote repository on the server, as well as in local repositories on different local machines.
Git: The most commonly used open source system for Distributed Version Control.
GitHub: The most commonly used platform that offers Distributed Version Control using Git.
Repository: A storage location of the versions of a source code.
Branch: Is an isolated track of code development within a repository.
Main (formerly Master on Github): Is the default branch where all the changes that have been made in other branches are eventually get merged into. It contains the most recent officialy working version of the code.
Commit: Is the captured state of the code in the repository at a certain moment.
Push: Transfering (uploading) commits from a local repository to a remote repository.
Pull: Transfering (downloading) the content of a remote repository in a local repository.
Pull request: Is a request to review changes in the code, discuss them, add follow-up commits if necessary and eventually merge them.
Merge: Integrating the changes made in a head branch into a base branch.
Fork: Making an own copy of a certain repository on your GitHub account.
Clone: Downloading a copy of a certain repository on a local machine.
