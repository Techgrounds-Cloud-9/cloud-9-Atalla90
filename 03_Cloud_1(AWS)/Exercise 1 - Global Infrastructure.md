# [Global Infrastructure]

[Getting to know the global infrastructure of AWS.]

## Key terminology

[Cloud computing: The delivery of different computing services on an on-demand basis. That includes services like storage, computing, databases, Artificial Intelligence, ..etc.

Virtualization: Running a virtual image of an operating system on top of another host system that runs a physical machine. It creates virtual machines using hypervisors.

Hypervisor: A hardware or software that is used to create virtual machines by isolating parts of the computing resources an allocating them to the different VMs.

Virtual Machine(VM): An operating system with its applications that runs on another system and uses an isolated part of the resources.

Data Center: A facility where servers and computing systems are housed.

IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service, is one of the three main types of Cloud Computing. It provides the customer with a whole IT infrastructure hosted on the cloud. IaaS gives the cutomer the highest control over their IT resources.

PaaS: Platform as a Service, is one of the three main types of Cloud Computing. It provide a fully managed infrastructure which allows the customer to focus on deploying and managing their applications.

SaaS: Software as a Service, is one of the three main types of Cloud Computing. It provides a complete product for end-users to use. With SaaS, the end-user is only concerned about how to use the application, not with managing, deploying or maintaining the infrastructure or the application.

AWS: Amazon Web Services, is the leading Cloud Services Provider (CSP) in the market. AWS was founded between 2000 and 2005 by Jeff Bezos, the owner and the former CEO of Amazon, and is officially active in the market as the first Cloud platform in the world since 2006. AWS offers as of now more than 200 Cloud services.

Availability Zone(AZ): One or more AWS Data Centers which have redundant (backup) power and connectivity within a region.

Region: A physical locations where several AWS AZs are clustered, located within 100 km of each other and interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking over metro fibers.

Edge Location: The location where data gets cached in order for it to be delivered by CloudFront with low-latency to end-users. AWS Edge Locations are located in many of the major cities around the world.

Regional Edge Cache: An Edge Location that has a larger cache-width than a global Edge Location. It sits between an original server and a global Edge Location to improve the content delivery performance even further by making the content available closer to the end-user for longer.

AWS Local Zones: Areas where you can use a selection of AWS services like storage, computing and database closer to end-users. They are mostly used for applications that require as minimum latency as possible.

AWS Wavelength Zones: Areas where AWS storage and computing services are embeded in 5G networks to help developers building mobile applications that require as minimum latency as possible.

AWS Outposts: A new AWS product announced in 2018, which implies deploying a fully managed AWS infrastructure and a pool of AWS storage and computing services at the customer's site. That way a cutomer can have a hybrid cloud that integrates AWS services in their own on-premise, and have a smooth, consistent hybrid experience.

RDS: Amazon Relational Database Service, is an AWS service that is used to deploy and mainatin SQL databases, using different databse engines from which the cutomer can choose.]

## Exercise

1. , 2. and 3. Check the terms in Key Terminology section.

4. There are many factors to take in consideration when choosing an AWS region over another:

A) Sometimes you may have to choose a certain region rather than another due to compliance with certain local regulations which your data is bound by.

B) You may also take latency in consideration. If the data needs to be accessed by the end-user with minimum latencey, then maybe it's best to have your applications deployed in a region that's as close to your end-users as possible.

C) Another factors to consider is the cost, as the costs can vary widely from a region to the other.

D) You should also check where the new AWS services and features that you may need to use are deployed, as AWS new services and features get deployed to different AWS regions gradually.
