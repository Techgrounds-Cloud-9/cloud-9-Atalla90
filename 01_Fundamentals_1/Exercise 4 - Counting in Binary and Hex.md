# [Counting in Binary and Hex]
[Getting familiar with binary and hexadecimal and transleting between them and decimal.]

## Key terminology
[Binary System: A counting system that uses base-2 numeral system. It has only two digits, 0 and 1. It's also referred to as "Machine Language" or "Digital System" because it's the language that the computers use internally.

Bit: The smallest unit of data in digital systems. A bit is either 1 (referring to the presence of an electrical signal) or 0 (referring to the absence of an electrical signal).

Byte: A unit of data consists usually of 8 bits.

Decimal System: The counting that humans use. It's a base-10 system, consists of 10 digits (numeral symbols from 0 to 9).

Hexadecimal: A counting system that's a base-16 system. It consists of 16 digits (numeral symbols from 0 to 9 and alphabetical symbols from a to f). It's used to represent large numbers using less symbols.]

## Exercise
Transleted numbers from binary and hexadecimal to decimal and vice versa.
