# [Asymmetric encryption]
[Getting to know asymmetric encryption techniques and methods and apply it with teammates.]

## Key terminology
[Asymmetric encryption: Also called; Public key encryption, is the type of cryptography where two, unsimilar but correlated, keys (key pair) are used, one of them to encrypt and the other to decrypt. The key pair gets generated at the receiver's end. The public key, which can be publicly shared, is used at the sender's end to encrypt the data before sending to that specific receiver in a unique way that can only be decrypted using the correlated private key that the receiver holds on and never shares. Asymmetric encryption has many applications. One of its most important applications is digital signature. Asymmetric encryption comes in handy when solving the issues related to symmetric encryption, since there's no one secret key that has to be shared and therefore exposed to third parties.]

## Exercise
Using asymmetric encryption I exchanged with my teammates public keys which with each one of us was able to encrypt his messages to their teammate individually. We were also able to decrypt the cipher text, each using their own private key. (See results in "Results" section).
