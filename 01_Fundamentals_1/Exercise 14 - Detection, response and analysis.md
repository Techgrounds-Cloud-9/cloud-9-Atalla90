# [Detection, response and analysis]
[Understanding the best practices and strategies when facing a cyber attack.]

## Key terminology
[Malware: Malicious Software, is a software designed to intrude into system to spy on them, make a damage to them or steal data from them.

IDS: Intrusion Detection System, is a program that monitors a network or a host system in order to detect (potential) attacks and notifies system/network administrators.

NIDS: Network Intrusion Detection System, is an IDS that monitors the traffic for the whole network.

HIDS: Host-based Intrusion Detection System, is an IDS that monitors activities on a certain host system.

IPS: Intrusion Prevention System, is a program that monitors a network or a host system in order to detect (potential) attacks and takes an action to prevent the attack or to contain the damage. 

RPO: Recovery Point Objective, refers to the amount of time that a disruption can last before losing more data than the maximum stated in the organization's Business Continuity Plan.

Business Continuity Plan: The plan of an organization to recover after a disaster or an incident.

RTO: The amount of time it takes a system to recover after a disaster or an incident.

System hardening: The followed practices to strengthen the system and make it less vulnerable against attacks. There are several strategies that can be followed for system hardening, includes; application hardening, network hardening, database hardening and server hardening.

DRaaS: Disaster Recovery as a Service, is a cloud service that offers backing up the whole infrastructure of an organization on the cloud where a disaster recovery plan will be managed without any action that needs to be taken by the business's adminstration.

Hot site disaster recovery: A kind of DRaaS that's used by systems that can't afford any amount of downtime. It invloves backing up the IT infrastructure on a second server in a stand by state.

Cold site disaster recovery: A kind of DRaaS that's used by systems that invloves backing up the IT infrastructure on a second server but not in a standby state.]

## Exercise
1. Their RPO is the data stored in 24 hours, since this is the time between two back-ups, which means that the worst case scenario would be them losing the data just right before a back-up and losing all the newely stored data between two back-ups.

2. Their RTO is 8 minutes, since this is the time it takes for the web server to recover.
