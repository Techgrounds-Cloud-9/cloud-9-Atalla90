# [Identity and Access Management]
[Getting to know about authentication and authorization as the two pillars of security.]

## Key terminology
[Authentication: AuthN, is the process of verifying the authenticity of the identity of someone or some service in order to decide whether to grant them access to the system or not.

Authorization: AuthZ, is the process of defining the boundaries in which a user or a service can act within a system after the access is granted.

MFA: Multi Factor Authentication, is the way of approaching athentication by applying more than just one authentication factor. Authentication factors are: Knowledge (Something you know), Possession (Something you have) and Inherence (Something you are).

Location-based Authentication: Applying a location condition based on IP addresses check as a factor to decide whether to grant access or not.

Adaptive Authentication: Applying extra risk factors, like the time or the location of a login attempt, to decide whether to grant access or not. Also called; Risk-based Authentication.

Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): An authentication principle that means granting a user or a service only exactly the privileges they need in order to perform their intended function on the system. Also called; principle of minimal privilege (PoMP)]

## Exercise
1. The differences between authentication and authorization are:

A) While authentication comes first as a procedure in an access control process to verify whether the entity that is attempting to access a system has the right to do so, authorization comes afterwards to determine the authorities that entity can have in the system after a succeful access.

B) Authentication can be modified by the user, while authentication not.

C) Authentication uses personal data of the user, while authorization uses methods like access control.

2. The three factors of authentication are:

A) Knowledge: Which means verifying the user's identity using something that they know, like a password for example. 

B) Possession: Which means verifying the user's identity based on something they have, like a smart card for example.

C) Inherence: Which means verifying the user's identity using something they are (belongs to them inherently), like their fingerprint for example.

-Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) provides more authenticity because combining more than one factor of authentication enabels each factor to cover up the shortcomings of the other.

3. Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) is an authentication principle that means granting a user or a service only exactly the privileges they need in order to perform their intended function on the system. It has the following positive impact on the system:

A) As it limits the access to what's necessary for each user, it provides more stability to the system.

B) The system becomes less vulnerable to common cyber attacks.
