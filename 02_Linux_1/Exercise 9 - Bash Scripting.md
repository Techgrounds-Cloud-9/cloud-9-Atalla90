# [Bash Scripting]
[Getting familiar with scripting in Bash.]

## Key terminology
[Bash Shell: The most common UNIX Shell.

UNIX Shell(Shell): Is an interpreter that works both as a command-line language and a scripting language. The user can interact with it through a CLI.

Script: A sequence of commands that are written in a single text and are meant to run consecutively.

File Extension: A suffex that follows a dot(.) in the end of the file's name. It provides some clarity about the nature of the file.

Apache Server: The most common open-source webserver that listens to http requests and responds to them.

HTTP Request: Is a request made by a client system to the server to access some of its content.

HTTPD: The daemon of the Apache Server.

Package: A file where other files related to a certain software are compressed and packed.]

## Exercise
Added a new directory as a value of the PATH variable and made a four simple Bash scripts. A script that appends a text repetedly to a text file, a script that installs, runs and checks status of Apache Server, a script that picks a random number within a certain range and appends it to a text file and a script that picks a random number and appends it to either one of two locations according to certain conditions.

### Overcome challenges
[I had a syntax error in the last script, which made me looking up a lot of stuff to figure out what it was. Though it was frustrating, I ended up learning a lot more than the exercise actually requires, which is somthing I'm truly thankful for]
