### Overcome challenges
[WE had in the team a misunderstanding that hindered us for some time about the construction of the Home directory and how it should be. We thought that the Home directory has to contain directories with the same names that are stated in the assignment, and therefore we thought that there's something that we're missing. It turned out that this doesn't have to be the case. We found that out when we asked the learning coach.
I do think that the way the assignment was stated was a little confusing to us, but I also learned from that situation not to interpret statements always in a literal way, but rather to think about what is really meant and what the target is.]
