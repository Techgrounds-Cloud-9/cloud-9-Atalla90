# [Processes]
[Starting, checking the status of and killing a process.]

## Key terminology
[Process: A task that's being processed by a machine.

Daemon: A process that runs in the background to maintain the processes that run in the foreground. It needs no interference from the user.

Service: A process that runs in the background and accepts requests from different programs.

Program: A foreground procces that the user actually uses and interacts with.

Telnet: a protocol that allows connection between a system and another remote system. The data being transfered through Telnet is not encrypted, and therefore it's an insecure connection.

Variable: A container of value(s) that may change upon certain conditions or interference.

PID: The identification number of a process in Linux.]

## Exercise
Installed telnetd package, started the inetd daemon, checked the status of the process and then stopped it.
