# [Setting up]

[Setting up Python3 interpreter an VS Code on Windows.]

## Key terminology

[Programming: Giving instructions to a computer to perform a certain task.

Script: A document that contains a set of instructions to be performed by a computer.

Code: A piece of instructions for the computer that is written (coded) in a language that can be used to communicate with a computer.

Algorithm: A set of ordered instructions for a computer to perform a certain task.

Programming language: A language that has a special syntax which with we can communicate logical instructions to a computer processor.

Python: A programming language that was developed in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde en Informatica in Amsterdam. It's famous with its simple syntax and its multi-purpose usability, which make it the most used programming language among software developers. Python is an object-oriented, high-level, interpreted (can be used as compiled) programming language.

Object-Oriented Programming(OOP): An approach in programming that depends on objectifying all the needed components in the language, meaning, making them objects with properties.

Interpreted language: A programming language that gets interpreted line by line through another program (interpreter) that translates it to a machine language that can be understood by a processor. It's usually more simple to use than a compiled language. Examples are; Python and JavaScript.

Compiled language: A programming language that gets converted to machine language directly without it needing to be interpreted. Therefore a compiled language is considered faster to execute and it offers more control over the hardware resources than an interpreted language. Though the code does need to be compiled (built) first in order for it to be excuted by a processor. Examples are; C and C++.

High-Level language: A programming language that enables a programmer of writing codes that don't depend on a processor's type. It's closer to human language and further from machine language.

Low-Level language: Also called; Assembly language; is a language that is close to machine language and further from human language. It depends completely on the type of the processor.

Machine language: A language that needs no translation or conversion in order for it to be understood by a processor. It consists of binary or hexadicimal digits and is very difficult for humans to read and understand.

IDE: Integrated Development Environment; is an application that offers tools to facilitate software developing. Fundmental tools available in any IDE are; a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.

Build automation: Automating the processes involved in a software creations, such as; compiling the source code and running automation tests.

Debugging: Keeping track of the steps in which a computer program executes a code in order to spot the (potential) issues in the code. Debugging is done using a tool that can be a separate program or included in an IDE.]

## Exercise

Installed Python3 interpreter and made sure Python was added to the PATH system variable. Installed VS Code. Printed "Hello world!" to the terminal using the following code:
 ~~~
 print ("Hello world!")
 ~~~
