# [Variables]

[Getting to know about variables and what they are used for in programming languages and how to use them in Python.]

## Key terminology

[Variable: A string of characters that works as a value container. The value the variable contains can change according to the rest of the code and along its way, hence the name "variable".

Value: A representation of data that's being used in code.]

## Exercise

1. Created two variables and assigned numrical values to them and printed them to the terminal, then created a third one containing the sum of them both using the following code:

~~~
A = 5
B = 3
print (A,B)
print (A+B)
~~~

2. Created a variable with my name and used it to print a message to the terminal using the following code:

~~~
name = "Atalla"
print ("Hello,", name)
~~~

3. Created a variable, changed its value several times and printed it each time using the following code:

~~~
X = "5"
print ("Value 1: " + X)
X = "6" 
print ("Value 2: " + X)
X = "134"
print ("Value 3: " + X)
~~~
